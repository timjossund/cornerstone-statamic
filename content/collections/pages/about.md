The Scriptures are inerrant, infallible and God-breathed and, therefore, are the final authority for faith and life. The sixty-six books of the Old and New Testament are the complete and divine revelation of God to man. The King James Version of the Bible shall be the official and only translation used by the church. (2 Tim. 3:16-17; 2 Pet. 1:20-21)'

Finally we will be permanently sanctified when we reach Heaven. (I Thess. 4:3, Phil. 2:12-13 John 6:37-40; 10:27-30; Rom. 8:1; 38-39;1 Cor. 1:4-8; 1 Pet. 1:4-5)'

        text: 'We believe that Christ instituted two ordinances to be observed until He returns – Baptism and the Lord’s Supper. Baptism, as a symbol of regeneration or new birth and identification with Christ and with a specific form of doctrine, is the immersion of the believer in water in the name of the Father, the Son, and Holy Spirit, and the believer’s participation in the death, the burial, and the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord’s Supper is a memorial symbolizing the Saviour’s crucified body and His bloodshed for the remission of sins. Matt. 28:19, Acts 8:36-38, Acts 2:41-42, Rom. 6:4-6, Col. 2:12.'
